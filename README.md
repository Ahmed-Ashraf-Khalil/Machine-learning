# Machine Learning Projects 


### Several Machine Learning projects describing :

* Steps of machine learning procedure. 
* tools to help you work better and faster.
* algorithms from scratch to gain the deep understanding of how Machine learning works and how it affects on data.


## Machine learning from scratch (python) :

We all know getting into Machine Learning it is all about the mathematics , statistics and probabilities behind every model and visualizing the important insights.
In this file you will know :

* How to implement (Linear Regression , Normal equation , Logistic Regression , K-Means clustering , Associaton rule - Apriori , simple reinforcement learning techniques ) from scratch.
* Important visualizations to gain better understanding about how Machine Learning works in depth.
* algorithms from scratch to gain the deep understanding of how Machine learning works and how it affects the data.

* [Normal Equation](https://github.com/ahmed13131/Machine-learning./tree/master/Machine%20learning%20from%20Scratch/Supervised%20Learning/Regression/Normal%20equation)
* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/ahmed13131/Machinelearning./tree/master/Machine%20learning%20from%20Scratch/Supervised%20Learning/Classification/Logistic%20Regression)
#### Unsupervised Learning:
* [Associaton rule - Apriori](https://github.com/ahmed13131/Machine-learning./tree/master/Machine%20learning%20from%20Scratch/Unsupervised%20Learning/Associaton%20rule%20-%20Apriori)
* [Clustering](https://github.com/ahmed13131/Machine-learning./tree/master/Machine%20learning%20from%20Scratch/Unsupervised%20Learning/Clustering/K%20means%20clustering)

## Machine learning With tools (Python) :

after knowing the basics and methods to deal with machine learning problems , tools and frameworks will make things easier
In this file you will know :

* tools to help you work better and faster.
* more advanced visualizations.
* advanced tools that takes you the extra mile.


What Tools you will need: 

```
pandas , numpy , sklearn , matplotlib , seaborn , apyori 
```
