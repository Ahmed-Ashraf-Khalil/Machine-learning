# Machine Learning Projects 


### Several Machine Learning projects describing :

* Steps of machine learning procedure. 
* tools to help you work better and faster.
* algorithms from scratch to gain the deep understanding of how Machine learning works and how it affects on data.

<br/>

## Machine learning from scratch (python) :

We all know getting into Machine Learning it is all about the mathematics , statistics and probabilities behind every model and visualizing the important insights.
In this file you will know :

* How to implement (Linear Regression , Normal equation , Logistic Regression , K-Means clustering , Associaton rule - Apriori , simple reinforcement learning techniques ) from scratch using only numpy and pandas.
* Important visualizations to gain better understanding about how Machine Learning works in depth.
* algorithms from scratch to gain the deep understanding of how Machine learning works and how it affects the data.
